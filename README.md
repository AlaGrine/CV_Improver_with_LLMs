## Project Overview <a name="overview"></a>

The aim of this project is to build a WEB application in [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that will scan and improve a resume using instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs).

We leveraged the power of LLMs, specifically Chat GPT from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/overview) and Gemini-pro from [Google](https://ai.google.dev/?hl=en), to extract, assess, and enhance resumes.

We used [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction), prompt engineering and retrieval augmented generation techniques to complete these steps.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

`streamlit`, `langchain` ,`langchain-openai`, `langchain-google-genai`, `faiss-cpu`, `tiktoken`, `python-dotenv`, `pdfminer`, `markdown`

The full list of requirements can be found in `requirements.txt`

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

- **Streamlit_App** folder: contains the Streamlit application.

  - `requirements.txt`: contains the required packages for installation.
  - `keys.env`: Your OpenAI, Gemini, and Cohere API keys are stored here.
  - `llm_functions.py`: reads LLM API keys from keys.env and instantiates the LLM in Langchain.
  - `retrieval.py`: the script used to create a Langchain retrieval, including document loaders, embeddings, vector stores, and retrievers.
  - `app_constants.py`: contains templates for creating LLM prompts.
  - `app_sidebar.py`: the sidebar is where you can choose the LLM model and its parameters, such as temperature and top_p values, and enter your API keys.
  - `resume_analyzer.py`: this file contains the functions used to extract, assess, and improve each section of the resume using LLM. It is the **core** of the application.
  - `pp_display_results.py`: the script used to display resume sections, assessments, scores, and improved texts.
  - `app.py`: It's the main script of the app. It calls all the scripts and is used to run the Streamlit application.

- **Notebooks** folder: contains the project's notebook.

## Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>

To run the app locally:

1. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv virtualenv`
2. Activate the virtual environment :

   **Windows:** `.\virtualenv\Scripts\activate`

   **Linux:** `source virtualenv/bin/activate`

3. Install the required dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Add your OpenIA, Gemini, and Cohere API keys to the `keys.env` file. You can get your API keys from their respective websites.

> - **OpenAI** API key: [Get an API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
> - **Google** API key: [Get an API key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
> - **Cohere** API key: [Get an API key](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys)

5. Start the app: `streamlit run ./Streamlit_App/app.py`
6. Select the LLM provider (either OpenAI or Google Generative AI) from the sidebar. Then, choose a model (GPT-3.5, GPT-4 or Gemini-pro) and adjust its parameters.
7. Use the file uploader widget to upload your resume in PDF format.
8. ðŸš€ To analyze and improve your resume, simply click the 'Analyze resume' button located in the main panel.

## Screenshots <a name="screenshots"></a>

Here is a screenshot of the application.

The results of the resume analysis and improvement are shown below.

First, the resume's overview, top 3 strengths, and top 3 weaknesses are displayed.

</div>
<br>
The scores are then displayed to give a general indication of the resume's quality. 
The resume is evaluated based on eight sections, each scored out of 100: contact information, summary, work experience, skills, education, language, projects, and certifications.

Finally, the analysis of each section is presented in a st.expander. For instance, here is how the work experience is displayed.
